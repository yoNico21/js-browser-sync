# Vanilla JS + Browser-Sync

Simple starter template to use browsersync straight out of the box with command `npm run dev` instead of having to set it up yourself over and over again for every project.

<br>

1. Install dependencies<br>

```sh
npm install
```

<br>

2. Run the command to start<br>

```sh
npm run dev
```
